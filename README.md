# France_ioi_solution

The France-IOI association aims to allow as many young people as possible to discover and progress in programming and algorithms. It develops tools and content for this purpose, and makes them freely available to the public. In particular, it co-organizes the Castor Informatique competition with Inria and ENS Cachan, and offers a platform for teaching programming and algorithms through practice and at its own pace.

These are my solutions, written in Python.

I will update the repo while I progress through the levels.
